### 📡 Technical Provisioning
* **Zero-Touch Deployment:** Users do not need to manage API keys individually. IT deploys the software; the license key activates the entire node.
* **Security:** All nodes are validated against the **Chambers Central Ledger** (Supabase) in real-time.
* **Privacy:** The Protocol is a "Pass-Through Logic Layer." No user data is stored on our servers; we only validate the license validity.
