### 🧠 The Paradigm Shift: Solving Agent Amnesia
**We have solved the "Memory Problem" by stopping the attempt to make Agents human.**

Traditional AI architectures treat Agents as "Brains in Jars"—when the process dies, the memory dies. The **Chambers Enterprise Grid** treats Intelligence as a property of the **Environment**, not the Agent.

By utilizing **Stigmergy (Indirect Coordination)** backed by a persistent Cloud Ledger (Supabase), we allow thousands of ephemeral, stateless agents to collaborate on complex, multi-day objectives without ever losing context.

> *"The intelligence is not in the agent; it is in the interaction between the agent and the environment."*

### 💎 Enterprise Licensing & Access

The Chambers Enterprise Grid is the unified deployment of the **Chambers Protocol**. It orchestrates **12 specialized Physics Nodes** that force Probabilistic Models (LLMs) to adhere to Deterministic and Biological laws.

We offer three tiers of node deployment:

| Tier | Scale | Usage Model | Access Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pilot Node** | Single Team (5-20 Users) | **25,000 Credit Allocation** | [**Purchase License via Stripe ($1,000)**](https://buy.stripe.com/6oUeVf0Nv61GgWR5i81kA00) |
| **Divisional Node** | Department (50-500 Users) | Annual High-Volume License | [**Contact Research Team**](mailto:Research@theeinsteinbridge.com) |
| **Enterprise Grid** | Global (Unlimited Users) | Unrestricted / Custom SLA | [**Contact Research Team**](mailto:Research@theeinsteinbridge.com) |

### 🔐 Provisioning Process
* **Self-Serve:** Pilot Nodes are provisioned automatically upon payment via the **Enterprise Gateway**.
* **Enterprise:** Contact `Research@theeinsteinbridge.com` for volume licensing, custom security configurations (SCCM/Intune), and **On-Premise HiveMind** deployment.

### 🌍 The Dual-Stack Architecture

v3.0.0 "Grand Unification" merges two sovereign engines into a single "Dual-Stack" brain:

#### 1. HiveMind Core (HMC) — *The Digital Brain*
**Problem:** AI Agents lose context when they restart. They cannot collaborate asynchronously.
**Solution:** A centralized **Stigmergy Board** backed by Cloud Persistence.
* **Persistence:** Goals, Tasks, and Artifacts are stored in **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**. Agents can crash, restart, or be swapped out, and the "Hive" retains 100% of the context.
* **Emergence:** Agents do not message each other directly. They modify the environment (the board). Other agents react to these modifications, creating emergent swarm intelligence.

#### 2. Functional Emotion Quotient (FEQ) — *The Biological Brain*
**Problem:** Organizations are complex adaptive systems. Standard metrics fail to capture "Culture" or "Burnout."
**Solution:** A physics engine for organizational psychology.
* **Flow:** Optimal balance (High Throughput).
* **Fight:** High Pattern bias (Over-control).
* **Flight:** High Reality bias (Chaos/Avoidance).
* **Freeze:** Zero Throughput (System Stall).

### ⚛️ The Physics Constellation (12 Nodes)

The Grid is not just the HiveMind. It includes 10 other specialized engines that handle domain-specific physics, allowing the LLM to reason deterministically about specific industries:

1.  **🛢️ Oil & Gas Singularity:** Calculates extraction difficulty based on depth/pressure physics.
2.  **🛡️ Risk Mechanics:** Models failure cascades and systemic fragility.
3.  **☁️ Cloud Operations:** Audits distributed system health and latency budgets.
4.  **🔒 Cybersecurity:** Deterministic threat modeling and defense scoring.
5.  **🌡️ Thermoelectric:** Innovation auditing for hardware and energy systems.
6.  **🚀 Venture Architecture:** Valuation velocity and equity structuring.
7.  **📦 Product Engine:** Feature prioritization matrices based on market physics.
8.  **🧠 Cognitive Psychology:** Audits leadership decision fatigue and cognitive load.
9.  **🔬 Research Innovation:** Measures the "novelty" of R&D outputs.
10. **⚡ Semiconductor:** Yield analysis and supply chain physics.
11. **🐝 HiveMind Core (NEW):** Swarm Intelligence and Memory Persistence.
12. **❤️ FEQ Engine (NEW):** Organizational Emotional Physics.

### 🔌 Model Agnostic Architecture

While the Chambers Enterprise Grid is often demonstrated with **Anthropic Claude** (via the `claude-desktop` integration), the architecture is fundamentally **Model Agnostic**.

The Grid is built on **FastMCP** (Model Context Protocol), making it universally compatible with any LLM capable of Function Calling / Tool Use:

* **Google Gemini:** Fully supported via MCP adapters.
* **OpenAI (ChatGPT):** Fully supported via the OpenAI Actions API.
* **Local Models (Llama 3, Mistral):** Supported via local inference servers (Ollama/LM Studio).

The Grid provides the **Facts and Physics**. The Model provides the **Reasoning**. You can swap the "Brain" (LLM) without losing the "Memory" (HiveMind) or the "Laws" (Physics Engines).

### 🚀 Quick Start (Operator Guide)

### **Prerequisites**
* Python 3.10+
* Supabase Project (URL & Service Role Key)
* Any MCP-Compatible Client (Claude Desktop, etc.)

### **Installation**
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Configure `.env` with your **Chambers API Key** and **Supabase Credentials**.
3.  Update your client config to point to `enterprise_gateway.py`.

### **Verification**
To verify "Digital Immortality" (Persistence), run the following:

**1. Create a Goal (Tester #1):**
> "ACTIVATE CHAMBERS ENTERPRISE. Run `sim_hive_mind_swarm` to create a goal titled 'Project Eternity'."

**2. Kill the Process:**
> *Restart your client completely.*

**3. Verify Memory (Tester #2):**
> "ACTIVATE CHAMBERS ENTERPRISE. Use `read_hive_mind_status` to check if 'Project Eternity' still exists."
