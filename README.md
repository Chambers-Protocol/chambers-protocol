## 💎 Enterprise Licensing & Access

The Chambers Enterprise Grid is the unified deployment of the Chambers Protocol. It orchestrates 10 specialized "Physics Engines" that force Probabilistic Models (LLMs) to adhere to Deterministic Logic.

We offer three tiers of node deployment:

| Tier | Scale | Usage Model | Access Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pilot Node** | Single Team (5-20 Users) | **25,000 Credit Allocation** | [**Purchase License via Stripe ($1,000)**](https://buy.stripe.com/6oUeVf0Nv61GgWR5i81kA00) |
| **Divisional Node** | Department (50-500 Users) | Annual High-Volume License | [**Contact Research Team**](mailto:Research@theeinsteinbridge.com) |
| **Enterprise Grid** | Global (Unlimited Users) | Unrestricted / Custom SLA | [**Contact Research Team**](mailto:Research@theeinsteinbridge.com) |

### 🔐 Provisioning Process
* **Self-Serve:** Pilot Nodes are provisioned automatically upon payment.
* **Enterprise:** Contact `Research@theeinsteinbridge.com` for volume licensing and custom security configurations (SCCM/Intune).

## Overview

The Chambers Enterprise Grid operates at the boundary between **human input** and **machine computation**. It exists to address a hard constraint:

- Unbounded language generates entropy
- Entropy generates heat (hallucination)
- Heat limits computation

The Grid constrains this process by forcing AI queries through specific, immutable logic kernels before an answer is permitted.

### The Constellation (Active Nodes)
The Grid is comprised of specialized reasoning engines, each serving a specific industrial domain:

1.  **Risk Mechanics:** Multiplicative failure modeling (Finance/Compliance).
2.  **Oil & Gas Singularity:** Extraction efficiency and safety algorithms.
3.  **Venture Architecture:** Valuation and market velocity analysis.
4.  **Cloud Operations:** Infrastructure, FinOps, and SRE logic.
5.  **Cybersecurity:** Defense-in-depth posture auditing.
6.  **Thermoelectric Innovation:** Energy physics and material science.
7.  **Semiconductor Sustainability:** Fabrication yield vs. environmental cost.
8.  **Product Strategy:** The "Idea to Exit" pipeline.
9.  **Cognitive Framework:** Psychological profiling and decision mechanics.
10. **Research (HPQAI):** High-Performance Quantum AI convergence.

## Core Principle

**Entropy must be paid for.**

Every invocation of the Grid:
- consumes a fixed amount of credits
- generates a fixed fidelity tax
- is recorded in an append-only ledger
- executes **only after atomic verification**

No heuristics. No retries. No silent failures.

---

## ⚡ Operational Usage

The Grid is a **Passive Logic Layer**. It does not monitor your conversation until invoked.

**For Enterprise Users (Auto-Invocation):**
IT Administrators configure the `System Prompt` to automatically route complex queries to the specific node (e.g., questions about "Drilling" automatically trigger the `Oil & Gas Node`).

**For Pilot Users (Manual Invocation):**
> "Run this scenario through `[Node_Name]_audit`..."

---

## Deterministic Billing Model

Billing is enforced **before computation**.

Mechanism:
1. API key is hashed deterministically (SHA-256)
2. Credits are decremented via a **single atomic database operation**
3. Failure halts execution
4. Success permits logic execution
5. A ledger entry is appended (non-blocking, write-once)

There is no read-then-write race condition.

---

## Fidelity Ledger (Audit Guarantees)

All protocol executions are recorded in a **write-once audit table**.

### Ledger Properties

- Append-only  
- Timestamped  
- Immutable  
- Deterministic  
- Human-auditable  
- Machine-verifiable  

### Canonical Ledger Fields

- `created_at`  
- `client_email`  
- `api_key_hash`  
- `operation`  
- `credits_cost`  
- `fidelity_tax_usd`  
- `request_id`  
- `metadata`  

Ledger writes are best-effort and non-blocking.  
Execution **never depends on audit success**.

---

## Mechanical Guarantees

The system guarantees:

- Atomic credit consumption  
- Deterministic hashing  
- No floating state  
- No silent degradation  
- No anthropomorphic interpretation layer  
- Explicit failure modes  

If a request executes, it was paid for.  
If it was not paid for, it does not execute.

---

### Explicit Invocation Guarantee

Chambers Protocol never executes implicitly.

- No background monitoring
- No passive evaluation
- No silent prompt transformation
- No hidden billing events

All protocol capabilities must be explicitly invoked by the model or client.

If a tool is not called, it does not execute.
If it does not execute, it does not bill.
If it does not bill, it does not record.

This is a hard mechanical boundary.

## Security Model

- API keys are never stored in plaintext  
- Only SHA-256 hashes are persisted  
- Billing uses a server-side service role  
- MCP tools expose no secret material  
- Ledger is append-only by design  

Tampering with billing, hashing, or ledger logic **voids the license**.

---

## License Model

This repository is **source-available**.

Commercial usage of the MCP server requires:

- a valid API key  
- sufficient credits  
- adherence to billing and ledger enforcement  

See `LICENSE` for full terms.

## Intended Users

This system is designed for:

- infrastructure engineers  
- AI platform builders  
- research systems  
- enterprise compute governance  
- operators working near thermodynamic or economic limits  

It is not designed for casual experimentation.

---

## Philosophy (Non-Marketing)

Chambers Protocol treats:

- Language as energy  
- Noise as heat  
- Billing as conservation  
- Determinism as cooling  

These are **not metaphors inside the system**.  
They are enforced mechanically.
