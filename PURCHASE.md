## 1. The "Toll Road" Pricing Model
The Enterprise Grid operates on a **Consumption-Based** model. You do not pay for seats; you pay for *Truth*. Every time an AI Agent invokes a Physics Node, it deducts credits from your Central Ledger balance.

### Tier 1: Infrastructure Nodes (The Utilities)
*Low-latency, high-frequency checks for digital systems.*
* **Cost:** 10 Credits ($0.10) per invocation.
* **Nodes:**
    * `cloud_ops_audit` (Uptime/SRE)
    * `cyber_shield_audit` (Security Posture)
    * `research_hpqai` (Quantum/HPC)

### Tier 2: Heavy Physics Nodes (The Engines)
*Complex, multi-variable calculus for physical industries.*
* **Cost:** 50 Credits ($0.50) per invocation.
* **Nodes:**
    * `oil_singularity` (Deep Sea/Extraction)
    * `thermo_innovation` (Energy/Efficiency)
    * `semiconductor_fab` (Yield/Manufacturing)

### Tier 3: Strategic Master Nodes (The Governors)
*High-value synthesis, risk modeling, and psychological profiling. These nodes save billions.*
* **Cost:** 100 Credits ($1.00) per invocation.
* **Nodes:**
    * `risk_mechanics` (Failure Modeling)
    * `venture_viability` (M&A Valuation)
    * `product_strategy` (Market Fit)
    * `cognitive_psych` (Leadership Profiling)

## 2. The "Triangulation" Premium
A typical **Chambers Audit** (e.g., verifying a North Sea Oil Rig) triggers a constellation of nodes.

**Example: "Project Icarus" Audit**
1. `oil_singularity` (50 CR) -> Checks Physics
2. `risk_mechanics` (100 CR) -> Checks Compliance
3. `venture_viability` (100 CR) -> Checks ROI
**Total Cost:** 250 Credits ($2.50)

> **Value Proposition:** You pay **$2.50** to validate a **$2,000,000,000** asset.
> This is the highest ROI leverage in the enterprise software market.
